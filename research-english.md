I'm a theoretical particle physicist working at the interface of nuclear physics, high energy physics, and cosmology. My current research interests include:

*   Leptogenesis
*   Physics beyond the Standard Model
*   Effective field theories, fundamental symmetries, and Electroweak symmetry breaking
*   Collider phenomenology
*   Dark matter
