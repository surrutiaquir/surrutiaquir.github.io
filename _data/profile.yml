  <p>
  I am Sebastián Urrutia Quiroga, a Chilean 🇨🇱 scientist engaged with the diffusion of scientific knowledge, particularly physics and math.
  </p>
  <p>
  I did my undergrad at the School of Engineering at the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (Pontifical Catholic University of Chile), 
  where I majored in electrical engineering. Then, I got an M.Sc. in Particle Physics at the Physics Institute at the same university.
  </p>
  <p>
  In 2017, I moved to the US to pursue my Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I was a member of the Amherst Center 
  for Fundamental Interactions. My <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/2724079" target="_blank">dissertation</a> focused on TeV-scale lepton number violation, exploring the interface between particle and nuclear physics.
  </p>
  <p>
  After graduating in 2023, I got a postdoc position at the <a href="https://www.int.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Institute for Nuclear Theory</a> and a visiting scholar appointment at Northwestern University, where 
  I continued my research in fundamental symmetries and neutrinos.
