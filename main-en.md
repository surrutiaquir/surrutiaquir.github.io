## About Me

<img src="my_picture.jpg" alt="" height="25%" width="25%" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;" >

I'm Sebastián Urrutia-Quiroga, a Chilean engaged with the diffusion of scientific knowledge, particularly physics and math.

I did my undergrad at the [School of Engineering](https://www.ing.uc.cl/) in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, where I majored in electrical engineering. Then, I got an M.Sc. in Particle Physics at the [Physics Institute](http://fisica.uc.cl/) at the same university.

Currently, I'm a Physics Ph.D. student at the [Physics Department](http://www.physics.umass.edu/) in the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as a member of the [Amherst Center for Fundamental Interactions](https://www.physics.umass.edu/acfi/).

You can find my CV _(Updated: Oct 2020)_ [**here**](CV.pdf).
